        <p>Laura Smith decided to go to San  Miguel de Allende, Mexico. She's 35 years old. Everything is 
          so expensive in San Miguel so an acquaintance told her that everything is cheaper in Dolores 
          Hidalgo. She has already spent a lot of money so she thinks is worth the 30-minute drive to get 
          some souvenirs for her friends and family that are in the USA. once there she realized that, 
          unlike San Miguel, no one speaks English and there are so many stores that claim that they have 
          the best quality and price.

          Caitlyn Smith accepted an English teaching position in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Before 
          starting her new job she decided that she wanted to explore the nearby towns. She heard that Dolores 
          Hidalgo has the best handmade ice creams, they sell cheap talavera that she can use to decorate. 
          She does not speak Spanish, and she heard that many stores like to sell everythinga at a higher 
          price to the foreigns. She doesn't know what store to trust and the real price of the products.
