            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h3>The Home Edit </h3>

            <img src="images\home-edit.JPG">
            <p>This website follows the principle of visual hierarchy because the user is 
              immediately attracted to see the bold text "organized in style" and the image 
              with an example of organization. The Home Edit goal is to organize your house 
              by following a color pattern. The website reflects the company goal by brightening 
              the colors of their image examples by having a white background. </p>

          <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
          <h3>The New Yorker</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank"> The New Yorker</a></p>
          <img src="images/The-New-Yorker.JPG">
          <p> The New Yorker Website has a clean design. The padding between the viewport 
            and the text is noticeable. Also, the white space between the images and the 
            text makes it look neat. The website uses limited colors (not counting the 
            image colors) so the combination between the many colors of the images and the 
            text is not overwhelming. The font size is not too small or large for the titles 
            and text. overall, the website looks professional for using this principle of 
            white space and clean design.

        <h2>The Rule of Three</h3>
        <h3>HM Cole </h3>

        <p>The rule of three helps a website form a focal point. This website is an example 
          of the rule of three because the focal point of this suit website is the man. He 
          is part of the middle of the grid along with the right grid. The text is also in 
          the middle of the grid.</p>
