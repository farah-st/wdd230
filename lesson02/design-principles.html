            This website follows the principle of visual hierarchy because the
            user is immediately attracted to see the bold text "organized in
            style" and the image with an example of organization. The Home Edit
            goal is to organize your house by following a color pattern. The
            website reflects the company goal by brightening the colors of their
            image examples by having a white background.

            The New Yorker Website has a clean design. The padding between the
            viewport and the text is noticeable. Also, the white space between
            the images and the text makes it look neat. The website uses limited
            colors (not counting the image colors) so the combination between
            the many colors of the images and the text is not overwhelming. The
            font size is not too small or large for the titles and text.
            overall, the website looks professional for using this principle of
            white space and clean design.

          The rule of three helps a website form a focal point. This website is an example 
          of the rule of three because the focal point of this suit website is the man. He 
          is part of the middle of the grid along with the right grid. The text is also in 
          the middle of the grid.
